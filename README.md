A little bit about myself:
⭐️ I'm a novice web developer currently learning the MERN stack <br>
⭐️ My goal is to make functional, interactive, and visually appealing websites <br>
⭐️ When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy going on walks around the city and seeing where I end up <br>
⭐️ I like to try out snacks from different cultures - let me know if there's something I should taste test! <br>
